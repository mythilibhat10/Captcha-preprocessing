# Captcha-preprocessing
Captcha preprocessing refers to the preparatory steps taken before analyzing and solving captcha challenges programmatically. Captchas are designed to differentiate between human and automated access to online services by presenting visual or interactive tests.
The preprocessing phase involves tasks such as image enhancement, noise reduction, and segmentation to improve the clarity of the captcha. It aims to optimize the input data for subsequent algorithms responsible for deciphering the captcha content.
